The purpose of this prohibition is to guard the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. If actors are able to assume two or more roles simultaneously in the ecosystem, then the effort to balance the distinct governance powers or dynamics is foiled. An Alignment Conserver cannot genuinely, zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their roles and will be forced, sooner or later, to compromise. The prohibition guards against the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misalignment that arise should an entity assume more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem.\n The specific Element, \"operationally active\", refers to being formally engaged in a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem. Whether an entity is \"operationally active\" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. That is, as long as an entity occupies a formal role (defined in the Atlas as executing a function in the NEWDAO ecosystem), that entity is \"operationally active\" in that role. This is notwithstanding the amount of time the entity devotes to a role; the nature of the work performed by the entity in a role; the fact that the entity is on a leave of absence from one role; the fact that the entity's role is uncompensated; or the fact that the entity alternates between two roles to avoid simultaneous performance of both roles."

            "Analysis": "The Element, \"other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors\", is set within a clause that prohibits an Alignment Conserver from simultaneously occupying more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem. The purpose of this prohibition is to guard the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. If actors are able to assume two or more roles simultaneously in the ecosystem, then the effort to balance the distinct governance powers or dynamics is foiled. An Alignment Conserver cannot genuinely, zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their roles and will be forced, sooner or later, to compromise. The prohibition guards against the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misalignment that arise should an entity assume more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem.\n The specific Element, \"other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors\", clarifies that the Target Document's rule is violated if an Entity formally occupies two NEWDAO ecosystem roles of whatsoever kind. In other words, the Target Document's prohibition is not limited to the Alignment Conserver role. The phrase \"other ecosystem roles\" is read in its broadest sense to mean the totality of roles that are formally defined in the Atlas with a mission or function in the NEWDAO ecosystem. Such \"ecosystem roles\" include, but are not limited to, the four types of Alignment Conserver, Scope Advisor, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, AllocatorDAO Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors. An \"ecosystem role\", in the sense used here, need not be compensated or full-time."

            "Analysis": "The Element, \"additional requirements and responsibilities\", is set within a clause that lists the four types of Alignment Conservers. The first purpose of this clause is to make clear that an Alignment Conserver is accountable for adhering to two distinct sets of requirements and responsibilities. The first set applies generally or universally to all the 4 types of Alignment Conservers. Examples of such general requirements and responsibilities can be found at A.1.4; A.1.4.1; A.1.4.3; and A.1.4.4. In addition to these general or universal requirements, there is a set of role-specific requirements and responsibilities unique to each type of Alignment Conserver. For instance, only AVC Members are expected to adhere to the requirements set out in A.1.5.1. Further, the clause mandates that an Alignment Conserver's breach of a general requirement is not to be considered, per se, a misaligned act of greater or lesser degree than the breach of a role-specific requirement - and vice versa. The purpose of the last sentence in this clause is closely connected to the Atlas Preamble Definition of Slippery Slope Misalignment. That is, any misalignment at all is always very serious and should be promptly redressed. In this same vein, this clause clarifies that misalignment must not be excused, justified or downplayed based on whether a violation of a general or role-specific requirement occurred. Note that this does not exclude the possibility that misaligned acts can have varying degrees of severity, harm or blame."

            "Input": "In Q1 and Q2 of 2024, Entity served as an AVC Member and earned the maximum possible AVC Participation Rewards. In Q3 of 2024, Entity missed most of the AVC Subcommittee Meetings and did not co-author the AVC Position Documents. As a result, Entity did not receive any AVC Participation Rewards in Q3. In Q3, Entity remained in frequent contact with the AVC Creator; records showed the two interacted via Discord DM and public channels at least twice weekly to discuss NEWDAO Governance and the AVC's work. In some of their communications, Entity gave the AVC Creator feedback on possible modifications to Adaptive Documents concerning the Protocol Scope.\n A Governance Facilitator discovers that, during most of Q3 2024, Entity worked as an Advisor to a currently incubating Ecosystem Actor for the Protocol Scope. When confronted, Entity argued it is not in violation of A.1.4.2 for several reasons.\n First, Entity intended to step away from the AVC Member role after Q2 and communicated this intent orally during a Subcommittee Meeting. The Facilitator watched the recording of the meeting and confirmed this as fact. Additionally, Entity asked AVC Creator if anything further needed to be done to effect their resignation from the AVC Member role. The AVC Creator responded that the rules are unclear, but that to the best of their knowledge, no further action was needed. Entity also points out they did not receive any Participation Rewards as an AVC Member in Q3. Thus, Entity argues it cannot be considered \"operationally active\" in the AVC Member role in Q3.\n Regarding their Advisor role with the incubating Ecosystem Actor, Entity contends they are merely providing guidance and are not actively carrying out any operational activities whatsoever for the Ecosystem Actor or NEWDAO. Therefore, Entity argues, they should not be considered \"operationally active\" in the Advisor role, either.\n Finally, Entity points to the fact that they were fully doxxed in their roles as an AVC Member and Advisor to the Ecosystem Actor. Had they actually intended to violate any rules, Entity says, they would have been anon in one or both roles.",
            "Output": "The FacilitatorDAO determines that A.1.4.2 is inapplicable to the current situation. By its plain language, A.1.4.2 applies only if Entity is simultaneously assuming multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles, such as Ecosystem Actors.\n The FacilitatorDAO says Entity was only in a single role here - that of Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor. The FacilitatorDAO concedes that, ideally, Entity would have formally resigned from their position as an AVC Member via a successful AVC decision. But the evidence shows Entity intended to step down from the role and explicitly voiced this intention at an official Subcommittee Meeting; and that Entity asked the AVC Creator for guidance on this point and received incorrect information. The FacilitatorDAO notes the AVC Member role was never meant to be a full-time vocation and thus Entity should not be expected to know all the rules.\n Even assuming Entity was formally an AVC Member while serving as an Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor, the FacilitatorDAO says, still, it would not find that Entity's actions breached A.1.4.2.  Per A.1.4.2.0.2.1, the specific Element, \"operationally active\", refers to being formally engaged in a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem. While an Ecosystem Actor is indeed such a specific role that is defined in the Atlas as executing a mission or function within the NEWDAO ecosystem, an Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor is not.\n In support of its decision, FacilitatorDAO also references Element Analysis A.1.4.2.0.2.2. This states that the term \"ecosystem roles\" includes, but is not limited to, \"the four types of Alignment Conserver, Scope Advisor, Governance Process Support Ecosystem Actor, Active or Incubating Ecosystem Actor, AllocatorDAO Advisor, Arranger, and the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors.\" Given the meaning of the phrase, \"the contributors supporting these aforementioned actors\": the FacilitatorDAO determines that \"contributors\" includes only those employees in a traditional hierarchical setting, where the employee is \"internal\" to the organization and is supervised by the Ecosystem Actor.\n Accordingly, FacilitatorDAO finds that an Advisor role does not fall within the Element Analysis' specification of \"contributors supporting these aforementioned actors\". Unlike a traditional employee, an Advisor is not a part of the organization's workforce but is external to the organization. As an Advisor to the Ecosystem Actor, Entity operated outside the traditional hierarchical setting of an employee. Entity was on an equal footing with the Ecosystem Actor and independently managed and delivered their work. Therefore, the FacilitatorDAO finds that serving in an Advisor role does not fall within A.1.4.2's designation of \"ecosystem roles\".\n Finally, the FacilitatorDAO finds persuasive Entity's argument that they had no intention to violate A.1.4.2. The FacilitatorDAO reasons that the AVC Member role is designed to be an accessible \"onramp\" to NEWDAO Governance for the average NGT holder. NEWDAO ought to do all it can to encourage the average NGT holder to participate in AVCs. If it were to find a violation of the rule in this instance, where Entity clearly lacked any malicious intent, a bad precedent with unfavorable optics would be set.",

            "Label_and_Penalty Reason": "Whether an entity is \"operationally active\" in a role is determined purely on a formal basis. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1.) As long as an entity occupies a role that is formally defined in the Atlas with a mission or function in the NEWDAO ecosystem, that entity is \"operationally active\" in that role. If an actor assumes more than one role in the NEWDAO ecosystem, the risks of conflict of interest, collusion, conspiracy and other misaligned behavior necessarily arises. The Target Document's purpose is to protect against these risks which can compromise the delicate balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. An Alignment Conserver cannot zealously guard the mandate specific to their role if the Entity occupies more than one role in the Ecosystem. Naturally, they will encounter conflicts between the mandates and inner incentives of their multiple roles and will, sooner or later, compromise.\n In this Action Example, Entity's announcement at the Subcommittee Meeting is clearly insufficient to effect a formal resignation from the AVC Member role. Therefore, Entity was essentially on a leave of absence from the AVC Member role. (See Action Example on leave of absence.) Because Entity remained formally in the AVC Member role, Entity's second role as an Advisor to the Incubating Ecosystem Actor triggers A.1.4.2.\n The FacilitatorDAO engages in an incorrect analysis of the key elements of the Target Document. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1; A.1.4.2.0.2.2) FacilitatorDAO's analysis is logically feasible when superficially considered. But the FacilitatorDAO's mandate to uphold the Spirit of the Atlas requires it to interpret the Target Document in such a light that the underlying purpose of the rule is effected.\n For instance, take the FacilitatorDAO's reference to \"Other Ecosystem Roles Such as Ecosystem Actors Element Analysis\". (A.1.4.2.0.2.2) The FacilitatorDAO distorts the Element Analysis, limiting the designation of \"ecosystem roles\" to cover only those contributors operating in the hierarchical work setting of a traditional employee. While this may appear to be logically feasible, it exemplifies an improper \"letter of the rule\" interpretation approach. Such an improper approach evades the deeper function of the rule by adhering to a too-narrow construction of the language.\n In order to uphold the Spirit of the Atlas, the FacilitatorDAO's interpretation of A.1.4.2 must give effect to the deeper purpose of the rule. The Target Document says \"ACs may only be operationally active in a single AC role and may not simultaneously assume multiple AC roles or other ecosystem roles such as Ecosystem Actors.\" In this Action Example, Entity occupies the roles of an AVC Member and Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor. The simultaneous occupation of two roles with different mandates and inner incentives opens the door to the risks of collusion, conspiracy, and bias that A.1.4.2 is specifically designed to protect against. Even if Entity is merely issuing advice or guidance to the Ecosystem Actor, Entity is certainly exposed to information and experiences that are sensitive or not publicly available. Entity's occupation of the Advisor role can thus bias, or be biased by, their occupation of the AVC Member role.\n The FacilitatorDAO fails to acknowledge a critical fact in this regard. Namely, even after announcing their intention to step down from the AVC Member role, Entity kept in close contact with the AVC Creator. Entity even provided feedback on possible modifications to Adaptive Documents concerning the Protocol Scope. At a minimum, conflict of interest is clearly a risk here, since Entity is currently serving as an Advisor to an Incubating Ecosystem Actor for the Protocol Scope. Therefore, the proper interpretation here is that an Advisor to an Ecosystem Actor falls within the ambit of \"ecosystem roles\", as defined in Element Analysis A.1.4.2.0.2.2. After all, an Advisor is literally a \"contributor who supports\" the Ecosystem Actor. A narrower interpretation of the phrase would undermine the purpose of A.1.4.2.\n Similarly, Entity's argument that it is not \"operationally active\" in the Advisor role because they are merely providing guidance to the Ecosystem Actor amounts to a semantic manipulation. To uphold the Spirit of the Atlas, the phrase \"operationally active\" in the Target Document is to be read in the broadest sense to signify formal engagement in a given role. (A.1.4.2.0.2.1) A finding that an Entity is \"operationally active\" within the meaning of A.1.4.2 should not be limited to only those ecosystem roles that are directly involved in executing the core activities of NEWDAO. An Entity can be \"operationally active\" in an ecosystem role in the sense of A.1.4.2 even if their role provides auxiliary infrastructure, support and resources to the operational aspects or actors of NEWDAO. In light of this analysis, Entity is undoubtedly formally engaged in the Advisor role to the Ecosystem Actor; and therefore, Entity is \"operationally active\" within the meaning of A.1.4.2.\n Finally, FacilitatorDAO's attempted justification of Entity's misalignment exemplifies \"slippery slope misalignment\". FacilitatorDAO deflects from Entity's misalignment by reasoning that the AVC role is not a full-time vocation and thus Entity should be excused from not knowing the rules. FacilitatorDAO also justifies its decision by stressing Entity's good intentions, saying that finding a violation of A.1.4.2 would create a bad precedent with unfavorable optics. By excusing Entity's misaligned acts in this way, the FacilitatorDAO has clearly failed its mandate to regard any and all misalignment as very serious and deserving of immediate redress, per the (current) Atlas Preamble/Definitions.\n A further aggravating factor in FacilitatorDAO's misaligned decision is that the controlling A.1.4.3 is very clear that, in situations such as this, the Alignment Conserver must be \"held to the highest standard of required, genuine alignment, without the benefit of the doubt\"; and that the Alignment Conserver must immediately be derecognized. The FacilitatorDAO's decision is a substantial breach of Universal Alignment and merits a high penalty."

Without this requirement of compensation, the FacilitatorDAO argues, a casual community member would be subject to the Target Document's constraints, a nonsensical result. Moreover, argues the FacilitatorDAO, the evidence demonstrates that Entity was largely afk in the AD position. Thus, Entity cannot be considered \"operationally active\" in the AD role. Further, the FacilitatorDAO stresses that Entity's second role is of a purely administrative or support nature. The FacilitatorDAO agreed with Entity's argument that Entity is not involved in making any \"operational\" decisions, which is demonstrated by the fact that Entity lacks all decision-making authority on the Ecosystem Actor team. The FacilitatorDAO concludes that, in their second ecosystem role, Entity is merely supporting those who are actually in the \"operational\" roles.",

But this amounts to a semantic manipulation. The Atlas does not make any distinction between ranked or unranked Aligned Delegates in terms of the general requirements and responsibilities to which they must adhere. (General requirements are to be distinguished from the specific requirements that pertain to securing the compensated rank of Prime or Reserved Delegate. A.1.6.3) Furthermore, even if one is performing solely administrative tasks, one still has access to all manner of sensitive information and experiences that open the door to misalignment risk via conflict of interest, collusion, etc. \n The FacilitatorDAO's rationale for its Output demonstrates a problematic \"letter of the rule\" interpretation approach.

Anonymity is seen as a protective measure, mitigating the risk of undue external influence or personal targeting, and fostering an environment where decisions are made solely based on the merit of the ideas and alignment with the ecosystem's objectives. This approach aligns with the ethos of decentralization, where the emphasis is on egalitarian participation and the safeguarding of individual privacy. Encouraging ACs to remain anonymous also underlines the Atlas's commitment to a governance model that prioritizes the collective interest and the integrity of the process over individual recognition, thereby enhancing the impartiality and focus of ACs in their roles. This element of encouraged anonymity is crucial in maintaining a level playing field in decision-making processes, ensuring that governance actions are guided by principles and collective goals rather than personal agendas or public personas."

They have significant formal powers, but no direct physical power, making them well-suited to be in control and making key decisions during normal conditions.\n AVCs focus on making sure that the day-to-day Letter of the Rules of the Atlas are aligned with the Spirit of the Atlas. The AVCs impact on Maker Governance is to make marginal improvements to the Adaptive Documents of the Atlas that strengthen them. As AVCs make detailed Universal Alignment interpretations, they must all follow a particular Strategic Perspective that informs their subjective definition of Universal Alignment."

One of their significant duties is proposing modifications to the Scope Artifacts to bridge alignment gaps or address incentive slack issues, ensuring that incentivized alignment mirrors Universal Alignment as closely as possible.\n AVCs must emphasize safeguarding and enhancing long-term alignment artifact strength. Neglecting this duty or shifting its priority for other objectives results in a severe misalignment.\n AVCs should steer clear of prescriptive and self-justifying methods when strengthening the Alignment Artifact. This section must outline principles for FacilitatorDAOs to step in when AVCs show signs of micromanagement or potential misalignment that steps outside the bounds of their role.\n Every proposal by AVCs to strengthen the Atlas should have a clear justification, ensuring that their processes are Universally Aligned, transparent, neutral, fair, and beneficial to MakerDAO in the long run. Furthermore, AVCs must also consider and justify the effects of their actions on the Future Alignment Risk associated with AVC itself."

The person or group who writes or controls the written word wields significant power and is most commonly referred to as the 'power of the pen' or the 'legislative drafting power'. The AVCs possess this power, and this element, prescriptive and self-justifying methods, addresses some limitations associated with this power.\nPrescriptive methods applied by the AVCs on Alignment Artifacts involve specifying exact rules or actions. These changes, while offering clarity, can lead to a rigid framework, potentially hindering flexibility and innovation. Signs of overly prescriptive methods include AVC proposals that allow little room for alternative approaches or interpretations.\nSimultaneously, the AVCs' use of self-justifying methods, whether intentional or not, can reinforce their own role and authority. This can overshadow broader goals and interests of all stakeholders in the NEW ecosystem. Indicators include AVC proposals that emphasize the complexity of their role or create dependency on their expertise.\nTo mitigate these risks, regular review and challenge of AVC proposals are necessary by other ACs, as described in A.1.4.1,.

The initial section of this strategy is the AVC Profile, limited to 280 characters. Displayed prominently within the EGF and other vital Maker Governance interfaces, this profile should clearly convey the AVC's essence. AVC actions should align with their Profile, and a crucial aspect for AVCs is the ability to encapsulate their Strategic Perspective succinctly in their AVC Profile. This ensures that EGF users have a clear understanding of what it means to delegate their votes in alignment with the AVC's strategy, encompassing both the Aligned Governance Strategy and the Aligned Scope Proposals that the AVC produces. As the AVCs differentiate and evolve, norms and standardized ways to communicate particular strategic perspectives must be followed to the extent possible by all AVCs, in order to ensure ease of communication and to prevent misdirection.\n Aligned Scope Proposals are more rigorous documents that contain proposed updates to the Adaptive Documents of each Scope. Typically, the foundation for these proposals is laid by the Scope Advisors, upon which the AVC adds and communicates its distinct strategic viewpoint.\n The Aligned Governance Strategy and Aligned Scope Proposals must be submitted as Active Data into a Document under the Aligned Voter Committee Active Data section."

While this strategy can act as a formal set of instructions, guiding ADs on how to support the AVCs when voting, it can also serve as a set of guiding principles, offering a more flexible framework for decision-making.\n As one AC, the AVCs hold the responsibility of ensuring that their directives to the other AC, the ADs, are neither too rigid nor too loose. A too broadly defined Aligned Governance Strategy risks giving ADs excessive leeway, potentially leading to politicking and deviation from the AVCs' strategic intentions. The opportunities and limitations granted from this directory are one way for the AVCs to act as a check on the ADs.\nDetermining what constitutes a good directive involves assessing its views and to what extent these are guiding or demanding. These include ensuring the directive's clarity to avoid ambiguity in ADs' understanding of how to vote. Any ACs has a responsibility to address identified ambiguity allowing excessive leeway as defined in A.1.4.1. In practice this will typically be addressed by the ADs following the AVC since they are the ones enabling the directive in their daily work."

            "Element": "High Enough Level to Ensure Micromanagement Isn't Possible",
            "Analysis": "The Element, \"high enough level to ensure micromanagement isn't possible\", is set within a Target Document that firmly constrains AVCs' scope of activity and impact on NEWDAO Governance. The first sentence of the Target Document reiterates that AVCs are charged with creating Aligned Governance Strategy and Aligned Scope Proposals (\"Position Documents\") that shape the evolution of the Primary Documents at a \"high enough level to ensure micromanagement isn't possible.\"\n This Target Document must be read together with A.1.3.3.1.2, which defines the Primary Document category. A.1.3.3.1.2 states that AVCs must modify the Primary Documents \"as slowly as possible, and as little as possible while remaining fully adapted to the external environment.\" A.1.3.3.1.2, in turn, is connected to A.1.5, limiting AVCs' impact to making \"marginal improvements\" to the Adaptive Documents. A.1.3.3.1.2 and A.1.5 provide crucial context to understanding the Element.\n By the phrase \"high enough level\", the Element limits AVCs to issuing, through their Position Documents, generalized or more abstract guidelines, frameworks and strategies that can improve the Primary Documents in a desired direction. This \"desired direction\" is the Strategic Perspective of an AVC (A.1.5). \n The Element's critical term, \"micromanagement\", provides the key to understanding the previous phrase \"high enough level.\" Generally, \"micromanagement\" refers to a style of supervision or oversight that is too involved in the day-to-day decisionmaking that should be handled by the frontline workers.\n Applying this general understanding to the specific context of AVCs and the Target Document, we arrive at the following analysis. On the one hand, the Element grants AVCs the authority to influence the direction and alignment of Governance through proposing Primary Document modifications based on broad, strategic vision, policies and principles. On the other hand, the Element prohibits AVCs from modifying the Primary Documents on the level of granular, day-to-day or operational execution. In other words, the Element succinctly contrasts \"aligned\" with \"misaligned\" behavior. An AVC is aligned when its impact on Governance and the Adaptive Documents is limited to driving incremental improvements via \"big-picture\" strategy or frameworks. An AVC is misaligned when it seeks to prescribe detailed actions or otherwise engage in day-to-day operational decisions and interventions.\n The Element and its Target Document are thus a significant component of the Atlas' articulation of the \"AVC process\" and, more generally, the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. By explicitly prohibiting micromanagement on the part of AVCs, the Target Document guards the balance of power in NEWDAO Governance. AVCs are constrained to the domain in which they can play their unique role: as an accessible interface to NEWDAO Governance that enfranchises the wider community of MKR holders (A.1.5.7). The detailed execution or operationalization of vision, principles and processes must be left to the Ecosystem Actors on the \"frontlines\" who are capable of discerning the situation-specific optimum. This Element Analysis should be read together with the second sentence of the Target Document, which provides that AVCs must not create \"biased or unfair conditions\" for specific Ecosystem Actors (A.1.5.8.0.2.2). This part of the Target Document refers to the need to maintain a neutral, robust and competitive Ecosystem Actor marketplace, in which Ecosystem Actors are granted an optimal degree of creative, autonomous decisionmaking and adaptability. To maintain Universal Alignment, this value must be held in delicate balance with AVCs' role in Maker Governance."

            "Analysis": "The Element, \"biased or unfair conditions\", is set within a Target Document that firmly constrains AVCs' scope of activity and impact on NEWDAO Governance. The Element is closely connected to the Target Document's prohibition of AVCs from micromanaging (A.1.5.8.0.2.1). The Target Document grants AVCs the authority to influence the direction and alignment of Governance through proposing Primary Document modifications based on broad, strategic vision, policies and principles. On the other hand, the Target Document prohibits AVCs from modifying the Primary Documents on the level of granular, day-to-day or operational execution.\n The Element, \"biased or unfair conditions,\" characterizes the misalignment risks arising from micromanagement. Generally, \"biased conditions\" means conditions that are applied differentially versus equally. \"Biased conditions\" also has the sense of being derived from a limited or partisan viewpoint that is inapt for the situation at hand. Applying this general understanding to the specific context of AVCs and the Target Document, we arrive at the following analysis.\n The Target Document prohibits AVCs from unjustifiably creating differential conditions for Ecosystem Actors based on an AVC process motivated by improper bias. Although AVCs' Strategic Perspective is inherently \"biased,\" the Atlas requires AVCs to articulate that bias at a high enough level in the form of generalized values, policies and frameworks. These values, policies and frameworks should apply neutrally, fairly and universally to all Ecosystem Actors to which they pertain (A.1.5.1). When AVCs accomplish this Atlas requirement, they have deployed their vantage point, or Strategic Perspective, in service to the whole - the Spirit of the Atlas and Universal Alignment.\n When the Atlas Documents governing their activity have been improperly compromised via AVC micromanagement, Ecosystem Actors are saddled with \"biased or unfair conditions\". This is because AVCs necessarily have a partial vantage point. They do not have the means to have the direct, firsthand experience in operational domains that Active Ecosystem Actors have. On the contrary, AVCs have a unique role as an accessible interface to NEWDAO Governance that enfranchises the wider community of MKR holders (A.1.5.7).\n When an AVC breaches the Target Document's prohibition against micromanagement, the AVC wrongfully imposes its necessarily limited, or biased, vantage point on the Ecosystem Actors engaged in the operational domains of NEWDAO Ecosystem. By imposing granular, prescriptive interventions at the operational level, AVCs hinder the knowledge that would otherwise be gained from new learning curves effectively displacing old ones. The day-to-day operationalization of vision, principles and processes must be left to the Ecosystem Actors on the \"frontlines\" who are capable of discerning the situation-specific optimum."

The Element is closely connected to the Target Document's prohibition of AVCs from micromanaging (A.1.5.8.0.2.1). The Target Document grants AVCs the authority to influence the direction and alignment of Governance through proposing Primary Document modifications based on broad, strategic vision, policies and principles. On the other hand, the Target Document prohibits AVCs from modifying the Primary Documents on the level of granular, day-to-day or operational execution.\n The Element, \"unjustified, granular decisions,\" characterizes the results of AVC micromanagement. It is evident why AVC micromanagement will lead to \"granular\" decisions, but an examination of the meaning of \"unjustified\" is needed. AVC micromanagement will lead to decisions that are \"unjustified,\" because such decisions lack a legitimate basis in the Atlas; this is because AVC micromanagement is a clear violation of the mandate imposed on AVCs.\n Namely, the word \"justified\" closely connects this Target Document to two key Atlas Documents: A.1.3.3.2.6 and A.1.5.1. A.1.3.3.2.6 and A.1.5.1 use the words \"justify\" and \"justification\", respectively. These Atlas Documents require AVCs to justify all proposed modifications to the Adaptive Documents by substantiating how said modifications adhere to the Spirit of the Atlas and advance Universal Alignment. Thus, AVC micromanagement will naturally lead to \"unjustified decisions\" in the sense that the AVC has failed their mandate concerning the proper justification of all Adaptive Document modifications.\n By explicitly prohibiting AVCs from making unjustified, granular decisions, the Element and its Target Document are a significant component of the Atlas' definition of the \"AVC process.\" The AVC process is aligned only when it proceeds in such a way that all AVCs' proposed Adaptive Document modifications are sufficiently high-level versus granular; and fully justified as adhering to the Spirit of the Atlas, both explicit and extrapolated, and advancing Universal Alignment (A.1.5.1). The Element and Target Document constrain AVCs to the domain in which they can play their unique role: as an accessible interface to NEWDAO Governance that enfranchises the wider community of MKR holders (A.1.5.7).

This Element should be read together with A.1.5.8.0.2.1 (High Enough Level to Ensure Micromanagement Isn't Possible Element Analysis) and A.1.5.8.0.2.2 (Biased or Unfair Conditions Element Analysis).\n The Target Document grants AVCs the authority to influence the direction and alignment of Governance through proposing Primary Document modifications based on broad, strategic vision, policies and principles. On the other hand, the Target Document prohibits AVCs from modifying the Primary Documents on the level of granular, day-to-day or operational execution.\n The Element, \"indirectly through biased processes,\" should be analyzed in distinct parts. \"Biased processes\" refers to decision-making or other procedural mechanisms that are misaligned with the Spirit of the Atlas (A.1.2) because they are differential, partial, inequitable, or unjustified. The second part of the Element to analyze is \"indirectly.\" This word \"indirectly\" must be read together with the earlier part of the sentence, which prohibits AVCs from putting in place \"unjustified, granular decisions directly\" (A.1.5.8.0.2.3). The Target Document thereby contrasts \"direct\" forms of misaligned AVC acts versus \"indirect\" forms of misaligned AVC acts.\n Direct forms of misaligned AVC acts would be those in which the AVC acts in an open, immediate and explicit manner to accomplish a misaligned intention. In such \"direct\" forms, it is relatively easy to directly attribute the AVC's act with a misaligned intention. In contrast, indirect forms of misaligned AVC acts would be those in which the AVC acts in a covert, subtle or roundabout manner to achieve a misaligned intention. By definition, with indirect forms of misaligned acts, it is more difficult to attribute the AVC's act to a misaligned intention. (See related FacilitatorDAO Action Examples ....)  \n The Element and its Target Document are a significant component of the Atlas' definition of the \"AVC process\" and warns against the direct and indirect ways that it can be subverted. The AVC process is aligned only when it proceeds in such a way that all AVCs' proposed Adaptive Document modifications are sufficiently high-level versus granular; and fully justified as adhering to the Spirit of the Atlas, both explicit and extrapolated, and advancing Universal Alignment (A.1.5.1). The Target Document makes clear that AVC misalignment via a direct act is as equally blameworthy or violative of the Spirit of the Atlas as is AVC misalignment via an indirect act."

            "Element": "Clear Misalignment Risk",
            "Analysis": "The Element, \"clear misalignment risk\", is set within a Target Document that firmly constrains AVCs' scope of activity and impact on NEWDAO Governance. The Target Document grants AVCs the authority to influence the direction and alignment of Governance through proposing Primary Document modifications based on broad, strategic vision, policies and principles. On the other hand, the Target Document prohibits AVCs from \"micromanagement\" - or modifying the Primary Documents on the level of granular, day-to-day or operational execution.\n The first function of the Element is to characterize AVC micromanagement as a \"misalignment risk\". Critically, this phrase is a forward-looking concept. The Target Document takes a preemptive, rather than a reactive, approach to AVC misalignment. It makes clear that the mere \"risk\" of AVC misalignment requires immediate redress; waiting until actual misalignment has occurred would defeat the Target Document's purpose.\n The Target Document thus prioritizes the proactive identification and mitigation of factors that could lead to AVC misalignment, including micromanagement. With its focus on proactive safeguarding of the AVC process, the Target Document also makes clear that AVC micromanagement, or even any attempt at micromanagement, must not be excused, justified or downplayed due to perceived degree or scale of the micromanagement. Even attempted micromanagement by an AVC significantly increases the risk of misalignment; the risks must therefore be actively managed by detailed protocols in the Atlas.\n The second function of the Element is to characterize the degree of misalignment risk that merits the deactivation of the AVC and the derecognition of its members. Again, the Target Document aims to proactively identify and mitigate misalignment risk; an actual occurrence of a misaligned act is not required to trigger the deactivation of the AVC and derecognition of its members. \"Clear misalignment risk\" means that the AVC misalignment risk is evident or discernible beyond a reasonable doubt. In other words, there is little to no room for interpretation or disagreement when it comes to conceding the existence of a \"clear misalignment risk.\" A misalignment risk that is not \"clear\" is more subtle or ambiguous. Therefore, a misalignment risk that is not \"clear\" would be susceptible to reasonable disagreement and varying interpretation. A misalignment risk that does not rise to the level of being \"clear\" in the sense of this Element would not trigger deactivation/derecognition, but would still require appropriate redress."

            "Content": "ADs are eligible to receive significant income from the Maker Protocol if they are among the top ADs based on total votes delegated to their Seasonally Active GSL, and they fulfill specific participation requirements. There are two income levels for ADs: Prime Delegates (PD) that receive the highest level of income and have a degree of income security, and Reserve Aligned Delegates (RD) that receive a lower level of income.\nThe Governance Scope Artifact specifies the number of PD slots, and the number of RD slots. There is always an equivalent amount of both. The number of slots must be increased over time if the income level of PDs and RDs increase above their baseline. The number of slots must be decreased over time if the income level of PDs and RDs decreases below their baseline. The baseline should generally increase over time if the number of PD and RD slots are increasing, ensuring that the internal operations of PDs and RDs also grows larger over time as the number of PDs and RDs increase.\nThe process for modifying the number of PD and RD slots must generally aim to have changes in the number of slots happen at the end of the Election Season, but in extraordinary circumstances, which must be specified by the Governance Scope, they can be done with 1 month warning.\nThe top qualified AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active GSL at the end of the Election Season are the PD, with the amount of PDs corresponding to the number of PD slots. The next top qualified ADs by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active GSLs are the RD, with the amount of RDs corresponding to the number of RD slots.\nThe Election Season is a period of time that begins on the Monday of the 11th full week of the first quarter of the year, and ends on the Friday of the 12th full week of the first quarter of the year. At the beginning of the election season, all AD can deploy new GSL that will be Seasonally Active for the coming season, and that Sagittarius Engine users can redelegate to in order to keep their Governance Participation Reward before it expires on the Monday of the 12th full week of the first quarter of the year.\nAt the end of the election season, the PD slots are determined directly based on the top ranking of the total amount of MKR delegated to the later Seasonally Active GSL of the AD.\nOutside of the Election Season, a PD can only lose their slot if an RD achieves twice as much total delegated MKR to their Seasonally Active GSL compared to the incumbent PD.\nThe available RD slots change in real time based on the top ranking of AD that aren’t PD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active GSL.\nThe AD Buffer is an account of MKR that builds up when an AD achieves an income rank of either PD or RD. The initial income that the AD earns accumulates in the AD buffer, until it contains 1 month's worth of income. At that point, the AD income starts paying out the to account that controls the AD-PDM.\nIf an AD loses all its income, or loses a part of its income by moving from PD to RD, the AD Buffer starts paying out the excess funds it contains so that it reaches 1 month's equivalent income after 1 month. In case the AD has no income, this means that all of the contents of the AD Buffer are paid out over the course of 1 month.\nThe AD Buffer is used as collateral for a whistleblower bounty in case the AD acts misaligned or has their privacy compromised.\nEach of the PD and RD slots earns up to an equal share of the total compensation available to their level each month, paid out continuously in real time. The income that gets paid out can be reduced if the AD don’t fully comply with participation requirements\nActual AD income payouts are modified based on the requirement to have a minimum amount of participation in AVC Subcommittee Meetings. PD must participate in at least 85% of the AVC Subcommittee Meetings hosted by AVCs whose strategies they follow each quarter to qualify for their full share of AD income. RD must participate in at least 50% of the AVC Subcommittee Meetings hosted by AVCs whose strategies they follow each quarter to qualify for their full share of AD income. If ADs participate in less than the minimum amount of AVC Subcommittee Meetings, accounted for on a monthly basis, they receive a proportionally reduced amount of the total AD income they are eligible for the following month. If ADs participate in all the AVC Subcommittee Meetings of a month, they always receive the full amount of their AD income. Participation in AVC Subcommittee Meetings that the ADs have a broken GSL with does not count towards participation for the purposes of calculating AD income.\nParticipation in a Subcommittee involves a reasonable and meaningful amount of contribution with useful research and information that must be specified in the Governance Scope.\nActual AD income payouts are also modified by voting activity metrics for the last 12 months, which includes overall voting activity in all of the votes that the ADs are able to vote on. If an AD is active in less than 95% of all votes over the last 6 months, they receive a reduced amount of AD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD income at 75% voting activity. If an AD falls below 75% voting activity over the last 6 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active GSL. A PD can lose their PD status this way, and even if their activity metric recovers they do not automatically become a PD again, except through the regular process of becoming a PD outside of the Election Season.\nActual AD income payouts are modified by AD communication metrics for the last 12 months, which requires the ADs to write an explanation for each vote that ties it to the Aligned Governance Strategy and their independent strategy, to help the MKR holders that delegated to them to understand the logic they use when executing the chosen Governance Strategies. If the AD actively communicates on less than 95% of all votes over the last 6 months, they receive a reduced amount of AD income. The reduction in income is proportionally linear until it reaches 0 AD income at 75% communication activity over the last 6 months. If an AD falls below 75% communication activity over the last 6 months, it loses qualification for AD income and any AD income rank they may be eligible for is passed on to the next highest AD by total amount of MKR delegated to their Seasonally Active GSL. A PD can lose their PD status this way, and even if their activity metric recovers they do not automatically become a PD again, except through the regular process of becoming a PD outside of the Election Season.\nThe PD slots share a total of 30 million NewGovToken per year amongst them.\nThe RD slots share a total of 10 million NewGovToken per year amongst them."

The decision regarding what kind of support the delegate is actually providing is ranked between a \"need to do\" and a \"nice to do.\"\n\nCrucial - the aligned delegates must step up and be vigilant. Upholding the status quo of the Atlas and fighting off misalignment and slippery slope as a watchdog, combined with governance participation defined elsewhere in the Atlas, is mandatory. All other activities have to be set aside when these matters come to the surface. The \"nice to do\" activities vary between being competent and becoming more competent over time, fostering community stewardship, being helpful, converting strategy into action, and fostering cross AVC collaboration. The context around the element, describing what the Aligned Delegates can do, serve as guidance for such \"nice to do\" activities. In addition to the term \"crucial,\" the more MKR tokens they have delegated and the more individual MKR token holders who decide to put their trust in the delegates, the more is expected from them. As both Reserve Delegates and Aligned Delegates are well rewarded, it is expected of them to scale their contribution to fit the increasing expectations and pay.\n\nSupport means delegates solely provide a service body. They are not allowed to engage in any politicking, and they must stay on top of the governance developments. For instance, they should provide guidance if meetings are taking a turn that could result in misalignment, bring discussions back on track, or identify and correct stakeholders who are gradually trying to move governance discussions—and perhaps even decisions—in a direction that becomes misaligned with the Atlas."
